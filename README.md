# Password-Data-Breach-Checker
This is a python project which can be used to check whether your password has been leaked in a data breach or not.

There are many online tools available to check for your password data breaches. But the problem is we cant blindly trust anyone.

So I have build this secure Password Data Breach Checker which will run in the command prompt in your own computer to avoid sending our data to other websites. 

I have used the pwned api to fetch data from server.

USAGE:

python Data Breach Checker.py your password
